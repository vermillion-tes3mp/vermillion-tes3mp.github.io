# Ingame rules
English only, please.
<br><br>
Cheating or abusing exploits in any form, or failing to report others you notice doing so is against the rules. This includes hacking stats, hacking items and gold, using third-party mods to give yourself an edge (such as tracking other players in-game), abusing problems in tes3mp to gain an unfair advantage, and any other forms of cheating the game. There is a zero-tolerance policy to this rule: ^^one strike, you're out. Forever.^^
<br><br>
Housing is limited. ^^You may only own one house per IP^^. If you are caught owning more than one, you will first be warned, and then banned ^^if you persist in owning more than one house per IP/user.^^
<br><br>
Avoid killing quest NPCs when possible. Murderer as a playstyle is acceptable, but attempt to grief the server and you will find your time here will be short. First you will be warned, and then banned if you persist.
<br><br>
Do not use items or spells that can increase an enemy player's attributes or skills above the maximum cap. ^^There is a zero-tolerance policy to this rule: one strike, you're out.^^
<br><br>
Do not conduct in immersion-breaking building in your house. Make sure your designs would make sense in the original game, as best as possible. We're pretty lax on this one: the least that'll happen is removal of the offending items and at worst it'll result in a cell reset.


# Discord Rules
Avoid posting anything nsfw in the discord. This includes nudity, gore, and anything that would make your grandmother blush. Profanities are fine, though.
tiddleposting and nsfw are an exception: ^^**gore, scat, and porn**^^ is still disallowed in tiddleposting, but anything else is fair game. 

nsfw is one step further: it holds the previous restrictions of tiddleposting, but porn is allowed. The punishment for disobeying this rule can vary based on the severity of what is posted.
