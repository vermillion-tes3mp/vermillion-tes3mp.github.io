# FAQ
## What does FAQ stand for?
A: Frequently asked questions.

## Can I kill X character(s)
A: Sparingly. Killing quest NPCs is frowned upon but not banned. Limit your slaughter to non-quest givers if you can, but don't feel obligated to listen to this rule if you have a good reason to kill someone. All Master Trainers, Creeper, and the Mudcrab Merchant are immortal and cannot be killed. That said, if you are found griefing by killing lots of very important quest NPCs you will face punishment.

## Why can't I get into the X building to talk to a questgiver? It's locked, and a player home? How do I proceed with this quest?
A: Displaced questgivers may be found at the top of the /furniture buy menu. Buy your questgiver, place them, and proceed with your quest! ðŸ˜ƒ

## I'd like my TES3MP.exe shortcut to point straight to this server. How can I do that?
A: Edit your tes3mp-client-default.cfg file inside your tes3mp folder to match the below settings.
```
[General]
destinationAddress =  vermillion.fluttershub.com
port = 20003
```

## When does the server reset?
Cells will reset after a set time from their first visit, Internal cells will be every 4 hours, External is every 6 hours. The server will restart every 12 hours and will reset both internal and external cells on restart.
## My stats glitched/my health doubled/I somehow reached past level 100/gold or items duplicated in my inventory/other character bug. Should I report this to an admin?
A: Yes. Admitting such things to an admin will build their trust in you. Meanwhile, someone who accidentally has items duplicate in their inventory and intentionally doesn't inform the moderation staff may be subject to punishment.
## Where should I input tickets for aid from moderators due to glitches in quests or otherwise?
A: The best place would be to join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/phrFT27) and asking for support in #admin-fixes-needed

## Why can't I rest in the wilderness?
A: You can. Use /furn to buy a bedroll, then place the bedroll to sleep. We do not allow you to sleep in the wilderness for two reasons:<br><br>
1. Difficulty - This server has no penalty for death. So, if nothing else, we've added this as a natural difficulty curve in that if you die, you're going to have to tread over old ground without the ability to heal along the way unless you prepare with healing potions and whatnot. 
<br><br>2. The Real Reason - Wilderness resting ruins PVP, as players can sleep or wait during PVP bouts and sneakily regain full health.


## Who is this mysterious, handsome Orc named Grum gro-Dornob? Is he anyone important?
A: He is TheDrunkenMudcrabs (one of the server owner) play character, He has a legacy from back in the Nerevarine Prophecies server. He, unlike his admin account, cannot cheat in any way. So he is, in essence, his connection to the community, away from the server-related accounts.
<br>There are more accounts like him, among others. 



## Will you be adding custom characters/quests/et cetera?
A: Probably not. Maybe, but probably not. This is supposed to be a vanilla-friendly server, meaning that while we do have advancements over basic MW to help with multiplayer we're still just basic Morrowind at the end of the day. No custom dungeons or immersion-breaking named Horkers. Probably.
