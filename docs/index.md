# Welcome to the Vermillion Wiki
<center><h3>**Server established: Febuary 13, 2019**</h2></center>
<center>The Vermillion server for [TES3MP](https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/releases) is a project by TheDrunkenMudcrab,
<br>a Morrowind Modder and [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/@thedrunkenmudcrab).

This server strives for a vanilla experience. You will not be bombarded with announcement messages in the chat every 30 seconds.
<br>There are no .esps, and no custom quests or lore-breaking content. 

That said, we do have some quality-of-life modifications to make this online experience more enjoyable, including: 
</center>
<center>
`✧ A customized crafting system with collectors and PVP-ers in mind`
<br><br>
`✧ A warp system, with warps to populated places such as: every city, every ashlander camp, mudcrab merchant and creeper, and the frequently-visited Vivec Arena Pit`
<br><br>
`✧ More than four server resets a day, giving players ample opportunity to garner the artifacts and quest items they need. `
<br><br>
`✧ Player Housing, with affordable prices that any S'wit can afford!`
<br><br>
`✧ A decorate system, customized to include the ability to buy Creeper and Mudcrab Merchant (at affordable prices, too!), furniture, companions, and guards for your home.` 
<br><br>
`✧ Player Markets, allowing players to sell their wares!`
<br><br>
`✧ A void-space storage system, for those who aren't about the home-owning lifestyle!`
<br><br>
`✧ A custom Discord chatbridge, allowing players to communicate between the realms!`
<br><br>
`✧ A /who command to check out the stats of online players!`
<br><br>
`✧ A level cap of 100 to keep PVP from becoming absolutely bonkers insane.`
